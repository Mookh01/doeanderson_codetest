# Disclaimer: 
I wasn't able to spend the time I wanted on the codetest but will explain the best I can with my approach. 
# Getting Started:
1. I first wanted to get connected to the API to make sure I get data. 
2. Once I got the data I started framing in the information in the general location it would be shown. 
3. The onClick solution was next and then I setup how to render each selected icon individually.
4. Next, all the social links were setup to open in a new tab.  
5. Form/Validation, I went for a simple library for a simple validation check for an email. 

# Running out of Time
6. I'll begin to work on setting up the ability to send emails. I started looking into EmailJS and also considered using Express.js. 
7. After this I'll connect to a DB to store the data.
