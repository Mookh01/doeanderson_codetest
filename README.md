# Getting Started:
1. I first wanted to get connected to the API to make sure I get data. 
2. Once I got the data I started framing in the information in the general location it would be shown. 
3. The onClick solution was next and then I setup how to render each selected icon individually.
4. Next, all the social links were setup to open in a new tab.  
5. Form/Validation, I went for a simple library for a simple validation check for an email. 
6. Setup the ability to send emails. I went with EmailJS and also considered using Express.js to get a server going. 

# Running out of Time
7. After this I'll connect to a DB to store the data. I thought about just writing to a local file in the code. I also considered trying MongoDB.
